# HW5 (Project)

## What to do

You may choose to do one of the following things:

* Implement another RL algorithm of your choice (e.g., TRPO, SAC, DDPG, etc.) and apply it to the fully-continuous pendulum.

* Apply your implementation of PPO to a new environment that you create (e.g., using [pybullet](https://pybullet.org/) --- although you are also welcome to build your own simulation with an ODE solver, for example).

* Parallelize your implementation of PPO and apply it to the fully-continuous pendulum (with computation done, for example, on the campus cluster).

You may also choose a different topic that we mutually agree upon no later than Friday, November 13.


## What to submit (due by 11:59pm on Friday, December 18)

Create a branch of our `598rl_fa20` github repository. Call this branch `hw5_yournetid`, with "`yournetid`" replaced by your own NetID in **lower-case letters**. In this branch, create the directory `./hw5/hw5_yournetid` in our github repository.

This directory should contain all of your code. It should also contain a file called `README.md` that describes your project (both the problem and the method of solution) and that includes both your results and instructions for how to run your code to recreate your results.

Remember that we expect each of you to write your own code from scratch on this project, just as on each of the other homework assignments.

**You are responsible for obtaining a code review from at least one colleague prior to the final submission deadline.**

Final submission should be by pull request.
